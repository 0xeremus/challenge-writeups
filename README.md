# crackmes_writeups
This is a repo of write ups for ctf challenges and crackmes.
They are all labelled by ctf and year and if possible will include the binary. 

I guess this is mainly to document my progression with RE. I started Reversing in December 2018. 

If I ever give the impression that I know what I am doing I vehemently apologise.

Most of the crackmes are from crackmes.one. Check that site out it is amazing!
