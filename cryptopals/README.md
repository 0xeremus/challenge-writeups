# Cryptopals
Solutions for the Matasano Cryptopals Challenges

I'll probably upload challenges in sets as I complete each set.

**I'm new to rust and so am deciding to use the broader rust crate ecosystem for these challenges. To have an excuse to explore them. If you want to see all my implementations for base64, hex, etc. check out [cryptotop repo](https://github.com/eremus-dev/cryptotop).**

## Running the challenges.
```sh
